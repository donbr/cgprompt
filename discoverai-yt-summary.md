## DESCRIPTION

AGENTiGraph introduces a new framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) through a multi-agent system, addressing key limitations in current AI models for complex, domain-specific tasks. Explore multi-agent dynamics with a KG (knowledge-graph). The system employs specialized agents - each leveraging LLMs - to interpret user intents, extract key concepts, plan tasks, interact with the KG, perform reasoning, generate responses, and dynamically integrate new knowledge. By decomposing user queries into manageable tasks and leveraging the strengths of both LLMs and KGs, AGENTiGraph enhances factual consistency, reasoning capabilities, and adaptability in handling intricate queries. A central method in AGENTiGraph is the semantic mapping of extracted entities and relations from user queries to the KG using BERT-derived embeddings. The Key Concept Extraction Agent performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) to identify relevant concepts and relationships in the query. Both the extracted elements and the KG's entities and relations are embedded into the same semantic space using the same BERT model. By computing cosine similarities between these embeddings, the system accurately maps user inputs to corresponding nodes and edges in the KG, even when terminology differs, thus enabling precise information retrieval and interaction with the knowledge graph. all right w/ authors: AGENTiGraph: An Interactive Knowledge Graph Platform for LLM-based Chatbots Utilizing Private Data https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11531 00:00 Multi AI agents and a Knowledge Graph 01:08 7 Agents with specific functions 01:43 Simple example and all 7 agents 03:03 Official AgentiGraph Workflow 03:51 Open questions and Think on Graph (ToG) 07:02 Every Agent explored with its PROMPT 14:39 Map entities to knowledge graph embeddings 22:05 Performance Metrics of Agentigraph #airesearch #ai #aiagents #knowledgegraphs

### Introduction
**AGENTiGraph** is a novel multi-agent framework that bridges Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), aiming to overcome limitations in AI models for complex, domain-specific tasks. The platform allows multiple agents, each leveraging LLMs, to interpret user queries, extract concepts, plan tasks, interact with the KG, reason, generate responses, and dynamically add new knowledge.

The framework includes **seven specialized agents** designed to manage specific tasks, which enhances consistency, reasoning, and adaptability when handling complex queries.

### Key Components of AGENTiGraph

1. **Multi-Agent System**: Integrates multiple LLM-powered agents with a KG to perform complex tasks in a structured, decomposed manner.
2. **Semantic Mapping**: Uses BERT-derived embeddings to map extracted entities and relations from user queries onto the KG, aligning similar terms for accurate information retrieval.
3. **Task Decomposition**: Queries are broken down into manageable tasks, allowing agents to interact with the KG and perform reasoning in a stepwise fashion.
4. **Agent Functions**:
   - **User Intent Interpretation**: Classifies the userâ€™s query type (e.g., relationship judgment, prerequisite prediction).
   - **Key Concept Extraction**: Extracts entities and relations from the query.
   - **Task Planning**: Decomposes the query into logical, executable tasks.
   - **Knowledge Graph Interaction**: Uses Cypher or SPARQL queries to retrieve information from the KG.
   - **Reasoning**: Analyzes retrieved data to synthesize relevant information.
   - **Response Generation**: Crafts user responses.
   - **Dynamic Knowledge Integration**: Updates the KG with newly discovered relationships.

### Example Use Case: Exploring Quantum Entanglement

**Query**: "What foundational concepts should I learn to understand the relationship between quantum entanglement and teleportation?"

1. **User Intent Interpretation Agent**: Identifies the query as a request for prerequisite knowledge.
2. **Key Concept Extraction Agent**: Extracts "quantum entanglement" and "teleportation" as key concepts.
3. **Task Planning Agent**: Plans tasks to map out foundational concepts.
4. **Knowledge Graph Interaction Agent**: Executes SPARQL or Cypher queries to retrieve relevant nodes and relations.
5. **Reasoning Agent**: Synthesizes information from the KG, identifying foundational topics.
6. **Response Generation Agent**: Formulates a structured response.
7. **Dynamic Knowledge Integration Agent**: Updates the KG if any new relevant relationships are found.

### AGENTiGraph's Technical Methodology

1. **Semantic Mapping**: Uses BERT embeddings to match user query entities with KG nodes even when terminology differs.
2. **Knowledge Graph Querying**: Executes structured queries to retrieve knowledge, although the framework currently relies on greedy query processing rather than advanced methods like beam search.
3. **Performance Metrics**: AGENTiGraph demonstrates 95% accuracy in task classification and a 90% success rate in task execution.

### Insights on Agent-Specific Prompts

Each agent in AGENTiGraph is configured with a tailored prompt to optimize task performance:
- **Example Prompt (User Intent Interpretation)**: "You are an expert NLP task classifier specializing in knowledge graph interactions. Analyze the given query and classify it into categories like relationship judgment or prerequisite prediction."
- **Example Prompt (Key Concept Extraction)**: "Identify and extract key concepts and relations, mapping them to the KG schema using BERT-derived embeddings."

### Potential for Further Optimization

While AGENTiGraph's current setup performs well, further enhancements are possible:
- **Beam Search**: Could enable exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously.
- **Custom BERT Models**: Domain-specific BERT systems can improve semantic accuracy, especially in specialized fields.

### Conclusion

AGENTiGraph represents a significant advancement in AI research, showcasing how multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs can be combined with LLMs for improved factual consistency, reasoning, and adaptability. The platform opens new possibilities for complex, structured information retrieval and reasoning in domain-specific AI applications.
